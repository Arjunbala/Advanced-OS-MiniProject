# Mini Project for CS736 - Advanced Operating Systems
In this work, we show how different implementations of the same OS feature can have different performance under different workloads.\
We target two workloads -
1. File I/O
2. Concurrency

We have a folder each corresponding to the two. Details on the workloads and steps to run can be found inside the individual folders.
